            <p>This is an all-in-one homepage where I will store my academic projects, namely my compilation of the history of science fiction as it relates to real world discoveries.</p>
            <p>My current goal is to track the evolution of science fiction through history. Particular focus will be given to periods of scientific discovery, as the science fiction that arises in their wake has a noticeably more exploratory and starry-eyed nature.</p>
            <p>It is my cursory observation that a better understanding of narrative also lends a better understanding of history. In both a Watsonian (within a story) and a Doylist (without a story) sense, narrative decision-making often reflects the culture, the period, and the zeitgeist that surrounded a given writer.</p>
            <p>It cannot be argued that history is not also a narrative in itself.</p>
            <p>A previous goal of mine was to track the development of 'pataphysical ideas through space and time, as well as their influence on literature, art, philosophy, and science. Additionally, I would have liked to confirm and put a name to as many 'pataphysicians as possible. My continuation of that project is undetermined.</p>
