            <p>This is an all-in-one homepage to store my academic projects, namely my compilation of the history of 'pataphysics, a proto-absurdist philosophy that inspired Surrealism, Dadaism, the Theatre of the Absurd, and other overtly unserious or satirical schools of thought.</p>
            <p>My goal is to track the development of 'pataphysical ideas through space and time, as well as its influence on literature, art, phiilosophy, and science. Additionally, I would like to confirm and put a name to as many 'pataphysicians as possible.</p>
